Welcome to my GitHub repository.

I started working in IT in the early 1980s, finally retiring in 2022. Although retired, I'm currently working as a part-time Visiting Lecturer at the University of Hertfordshire. 

From 2017 until 2022, I worked as a Senior Technical Instructor for Amazon Web Services (AWS), and was reponsible for building a number of example AWS demos, to demonstrate the AWS managed services. Upon retirement, I have continued to take an interest in AWS services. 

These repositories contain various artifacts to enable trainers, or students, to easily and cost-effectively demonstrate how AWS services work. In many cases, the repos contain master CloudFormation templates which means that demos can be easily built up and then torn down using Cloudformation.

The name 'dendad' came from my Amazon.Com email address at that time, and the nickname caught on, so that many of my colleagues knew me by the 'dendad' moniker, rather than using my real name. I've continued to use the nickname, partly as an acknowledgement of their contribution to my professional life.

I've also retained the 'dendad_trainer' Twitter account, so do link up with me that way, or look for me on LinkedIn. 

If you have ideas of 'canned' AWS demos you would like to see, do let me know, and I'll see what I can do !

God bless

Dennis Adams
